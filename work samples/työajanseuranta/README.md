Here are some screenshots about a transport company's working hours monitoring application I programmed for my customer.

The software runs on Laravel framework. Driver's views have been created with traditional HTML / CSS / JavaScript programming and the more complex admin views have been programmed with ReactJS. The application has a dedicated MySQL database and it is connected to Wordpress database for user information and authentication.
