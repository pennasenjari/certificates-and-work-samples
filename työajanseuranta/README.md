Here are some screenshots about a work time monitoring web application I programmed for my customer few years ago.

The software runs on Laravel framework. The driver's views are created with traditional HTML / CSS / JavaScript programming and the admin views are programmed with ReactJS. The related user database resides in customer's intranet in Wordpress and there is a bridge between Laravel and Wordpress to exhcange the user data.

I don't have permisson to show the code but I programmed the whole thing based on layouts given to me.
